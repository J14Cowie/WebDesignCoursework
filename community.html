<!--Paragraphs of our work with Home-Start-->
        <p>Home-Start is a local community network of trained volunteers and expert support helping families with young children through their challenging times. They are there for parents when they need them the most because childhood canâ€™t wait.</p>
        <p>Struggling families are unfortunately very common in scotland, and is something that we feel strongly needs to be made well aware to the public. That is why we work with charities such as Home-Start, because they are determined to provide care and assistance to the thousands of families across the uk who need it the most.</p>
        <p>Follow the link below to read more about what Home-Start is and what they are doing to make sure they are there for families who desperately need their help.</p>

<!--Paragraphs of how a student can help us with charitable work-->
        <p>Every year thousands of parents and children are turned away from Home-Start's services simply because they just havent the funds to help them all.</p>
        <p>The way we help is through holding fundraising events, and we would love for you to be apart of that in any way you can.</p>
        <p>If you are interested in helping us raise awareness and funds for parents and children who really need it then please get in contact with us, we would love to hear from you. And dont hesitate to contribute any ideas you may have for how we can do more.</p>
